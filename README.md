https://dt-tom.github.io/SpringSummoner/

*GAME by Jacob Baum (@jacob-baum) , ecb (@ecb) , adamag (@adamag) , twist (@twist), and tunagoo (@tunagoo)*

## Gameplay
Movement is with WASD or arrow keys. Click to summon

## Local development

Runs within a webserver. I suggest `npx serve .` (requires npm) from the project
root but any webserver will work.

## Design tokens

Design tokens are the building blocks of a visual language. We should try to
base as much as possible on these basics to remain visually consistent.
__Sizes__

Tiles are 32x32 px. Normal text is N pt. Large text is M pt.

__Colors__

We're on that sandy palette. Actual colors TODO.

__Typefaces__

For ingame text, Eric suggests [Jersey 20
Charted](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jersey+20+Charted), but he didn't
put much thought into the choice.
